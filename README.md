# sbkernelsign

TODO, sorry.

For some background check [ansemjo/mksignkernels](https://github.com/ansemjo/mksignkernels)
and [andreyv/sbupdate](https://github.com/andreyv/sbupdate).

This script does the same thing. It is another reimplementation because I
didn't understand my own Makefile voodoo in `mksignkernels` after not touching
it for a while -- which bit me when I needed to rescue my system recently.
